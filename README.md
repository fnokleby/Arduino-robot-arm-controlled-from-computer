# Arduino arm controlled from pc running python script.

This project is a prototype robot arm and controller. The robot it self is made out of an old pizza box, and uses servos attached to an arduino. The arduino recives data over serial from a computer. The computer runs a python script and has a very rudimentary gui.  

## Parts
* SG-5010 Tower Pro Servo
* SKM-S2309s
* Arduino (I used an UNO)
* A computer capable of running a .py script.
* Usb cable.
* 12V power supply (Decent amperage, servos need quite a lot at times).
* A pizza box.
